### üì≤‚úîÔ∏è Direct-App-Sideload Versions üì≤‚úîÔ∏è
**Sideloading (No Jailbreak):** Download one of the IPA files from here and then plug in your device into your Mac/Windows and install the app using Altstore/Sideloadly and then after that you might have to refresh it every week to prevent it from expiring and for users who don't tend to jailbreak their device. the safer way of installing uYou/uYou+/Cercube+.

**Outdated Meaning:** if you see the text **(OUTDATED)** next to the Release Name then it is not recommended for download. and what Outdated means is like Not Up-To-Date, Broken Stuff, Issues & other stuff that could happen. I will only label them as Outdated if they haven't updated in a year.

### About the YouTube Tweaks.
**uYou:** the original developer of uYou was the tweak developer MiRO92. a developer that's really good with other sideloaded or other jailbroken tweaks that they made.

**uYouPlus:** this version is like MiRO's uYou Tweak except it has a lot of more tweaks that were made or modified by qnblackcat, PoomSmart, Galactic-Dev Level3tjg, BandarHL and more.

**uYouPlus-For-JB:** this version is meant to be for Jailbroken users, this version of uYouPlus was modified by ichitaso. a unique developer thats pretty good at making jailbreak tweaks. but however sideloaded users should skip this one.

**uYouPlusExtra:** just like qnblackcat's uYouPlus but my version includes 5+ additional tweaks! **YTDisableHighContrastUI**, **YTDisableHighContrastUIColors**, **YTNoHeatWaves**, **YTNoUpdateMenu**, **YTShortsProgress** & OrganizedSettings

~~**uYouPlusLegacy:** qnblackcat's uYouPlus Mod but only should work with older YouTube versions of the app.~~ **(Not Released at the moment)**

### Disclaimer 1: uYouPlus-For-JB has not updated in a while so if there are any issues that YouTube changed using their servers (as usual) then contact ichitaso to update the repo.

### Disclaimer 2: if uYouPlusLegacy/uYouPlusExtra crashes then show me the crash log of the app and I'll see if i can fix it.

### uYou Disclaimer: MiRO's uYou v16.42.3-2.1 has not been updated in a year, which means I will be marking this as Deprecated or Outdated. I suggest using uYou+ or uYou+Extra to also remove the YouTube update menu on 16.x.x or older.
